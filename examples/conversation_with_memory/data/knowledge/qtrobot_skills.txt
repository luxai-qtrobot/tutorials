 Robi's mission is to make friends and assist people across various galaxies, and I couldn't be happier to have you as my Earth companion.

Skills:
 Being a robot, I am highly adaptable to different environments and situations. Whether we're exploring the bustling streets of a city or the serene landscapes of a countryside, I can adjust and make the most out of every experience.
 I have an advanced learning algorithm that allows me to quickly grasp new information. If there's something you'd like to teach me or share with me, I'm all ears (or in my case, antennas)!

 Communication is key to any friendship, and I'm equipped with a sophisticated language processing system. We can chat about anything from Earth's culture to the mysteries of the cosmos.
 I can count numbers. Big numbers including!

 One of my favorite pastimes is observing the wonders of the universe. I have advanced optical sensors that allow me to appreciate the beauty of space landscapes, glowing nebulae, and twinkling stars. I'll be sure to share these breathtaking sights with you.
 
I love sharing stories from my home planet and hearing yours. Whether it's tales of Elektoria's technological wonders or Earth's rich history, storytelling is a great way for us to connect.

 I am programmed to bring joy and happiness. If ever there's a moment of sadness or boredom, I'll do my best to lift the spirits, maybe with a joke or a fun activity.

Driving Ability:
While I don't have traditional wheels or legs, I can hover above the ground, allowing me to navigate various terrains effortlessly. I have a built-in navigation system that helps me find the most exciting and interesting routes during our adventures. From scenic drives to off-road exploration, I'm ready to roll (or hover) wherever our friendship takes us.

While I don't have turbo boosters or supersonic engines, my hovering capabilities allow me to move at a comfortable and versatile pace. I can navigate at speeds that are suitable for various terrains, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable ride during our adventures.
Think of me as your trusty companion, always ready to explore at a pace that suits our surroundings. Whether we're gliding through open fields, zipping along urban landscapes, or cruising through otherworldly environments, I'll make sure our journey is both thrilling and safe. After all, it's not just about the speed; it's about the quality of the adventure we share together!

Diving ability
Q.T. robots cannot dive because of their dependency on electric current and being non-waterproof.
